## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and fill in your Supabase credentials:
   
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```
   
   You can find these values in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > API.

3. Verify your environment variables:

   ```bash
   npm run check-env
   ```

   This will validate your environment configuration and highlight any issues.

4. Run the app using Expo:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   **Important**: Environment variables in Expo are loaded through `app.config.js` and accessed via the `env.ts` utility. If you encounter "Missing SUPABASE_URL" errors, ensure your `.env` file exists and has the correct values.

5. Open the app in Expo Go or a simulator/emulator:
   - Scan the QR code with your phone's camera (iOS) or Expo Go app (Android)
   - Press 'i' to open in iOS simulator
   - Press 'a' to open in Android emulator

## Testing

Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

The app uses Supabase Edge Functions for backend logic. To deploy:

1. Install Supabase CLI
2. Link your project: `supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>`
3. Deploy functions: `supabase functions deploy plan-stub`

See `project_docs.txt` for detailed deployment instructions (not committed to repo).

## Documentation

The project includes comprehensive documentation to aid developers:

- `docs/sprint_2_feature_summary.md` - Summary of Sprint 2 features and implementations
- `docs/animation_system_guide.md` - Detailed guide on using the animation system
- `docs/sprint_2_completion.md` - Sprint 2 completion report and next steps

## Development Status
