# Sprint 1 PR: Core Authentication & Infrastructure

## Overview
This PR completes Sprint 1 tasks, implementing the core authentication system and infrastructure for the MuhsinAI app. It includes Supabase magic link authentication, profile bootstrapping, and integration with the store.

## Changes
- Added Supabase auth client with AsyncStorage persistence
- Implemented AuthProvider context and hook for auth state management
- Created profile bootstrapping on first sign-in
- Added sign-in screen with magic link authentication
- Updated store to hydrate from database
- Added proper routing based on authentication state
- Implemented environment variable validation
- Added QA checklist for testing

## Testing Instructions
1. Clone the branch and install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Supabase credentials
3. Run `npm run check-env` to verify the environment setup
4. Start the app with `npm start`
5. Test the authentication flow:
   - Sign in with an email address
   - Check the magic link in the console (development mode)
   - Verify that the profile page shows after authentication
   - Sign out and verify you're redirected to sign in
